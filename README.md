# Forest Fire Spread Simulation

This project simulates and predicts forest fire spread using AI/ML models like U-Net and Cellular Automata.

## Features
- Fire probability prediction map for the next day.
- Spread simulation for 1/2/3/6/12 hours.
- Input data includes weather, terrain, LULC, and human activity layers.
- Output raster resolution: 30m.

## Tools
- Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- Rasterio, GDAL, NumPy, Matplotlib
